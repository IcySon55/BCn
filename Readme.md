BCn
===================

BCn is a C# port of some of the BCn encoders in the
[DirectXTex texture processing library](http://directxtex.codeplex.com/).
It supports encoding to BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4, and BC5.

The library is highly modular. Its core works with a single
block at once, making it trivial to integrate with customized
image formats.
